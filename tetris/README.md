The initial goal of this program was to create a "tetris" engine with no rotation, a friend got this as a coding take home exercise and I thought it sounded fun. Initially, I was printing to stdout to display the game and this got cumbersome fast. I was familiar with the idea of the ncurses library and took this as an opportunity to learn it. This represents by far the most coding I've done in 8 years or so (perl), or 10 years since the last time I did anything in C (back in school). The only code copied from a website verbatim is the rng initializer though this is probably idiomatic. Writing this also told me that rand() % 7 will always return 0! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7866754/why-does-rand-7-always-return-0 This code has no license because I frankly don't know anything about them. I'm planning on coming back and fixing rotation and line removal.
